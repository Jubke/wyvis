Reactions in the chamber last from several minutes to hours or even days. Data sets of up several 100,000 data points might be recorded. Each data point consists of the above two values and a timestamp. When data sets are later analyzed, an overview of all data sets is required. For each set abnormal behavior has to be identified. For that data sets sometimes need to be analyzed on the most detailed level of several seconds.",
